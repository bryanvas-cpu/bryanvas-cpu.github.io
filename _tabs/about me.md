## Brief Introduction

Welcome! My name is [Bryan](https://github.com/bryanvas-cpu), and I am a robotics enthusiast, software developer, and an avid learner. This space serves as my platform to share projects, insights, and knowledge as I explore the intersections of technology, innovation, and creativity.

My primary areas of expertise include:
- **Robotics Engineering**: Design, and Testing autonomous systems for real-world applications.
- **Software Development**: Crafting innovative solutions using modern programming languages, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence.
- **Open-Source Contributions**: Sharing code and collaborating with a global community.

I believe that continuous learning and collaboration are key to shaping the future. Technology is more than just a tool; it is a catalyst for solving problems, connecting people, and driving meaningful change.

# My Journey

I embarked on my journey into robotics during my first year at IIT Dhanbad. This was when I quickly gained proficiency in a wide range of tools, including [ROS2](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/_downloads/2a9c64e08982f3709e23d20e5dc9f294/ros2-brochure-ltr-web.pdf), [Simulations](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/video/gputechconf/gtc/2019/presentation/s9918-isaac-gym.pdf), Control and Hardware Interfacing, and [Kinematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics). Throughout this time, I built a strong foundation in the essential technologies that drive modern robotics.

In my second year, I was fortunate to be recognized by Professor [Shikha Singh](https://iitism.irins.org/profile/215120), under whom I had the opportunity to work for three months developing a prototype [UMV](https://bryanvas-cpu.github.io/posts/Unmanned-Vehicle/). This experience further deepened my knowledge and provided me with valuable insights into the field.

Since then, I have developed a strong interest in, [Vision based Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Learning_in_computer_vision),and [Deep Reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_reinforcement_learning)-based models, and I am currently applying these techniques in my work on a Hexapod project, where I continue to explore and refine my skills in this exciting area of robotics.

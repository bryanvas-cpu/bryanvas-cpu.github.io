# Unmanned Land Rover: Design, Implementation, and Testing

Creating an unmanned land rover has been an exciting and educational journey. This project, a collaboration with [Prof. Shikha Singh](https://iitism.irins.org/profile/215120), demonstrates how innovation and teamwork can solve real-world challenges in robotics.

## Project Overview

The unmanned land rover was designed to:
- Navigate rough terrain.
- Use advanced sensor systems for monitoring its status, and environment.
- Demonstrate modular hardware and scalable software.

This project combines mechanical design, software algorithms, and sensor integration to achieve full autonomy.

## Technical Details

### Hardware
- **Base Platform:** Custom-built chassis - nothing special here
- **Sensors:** Inclination, ambient_temp, speed, weight, battery_level, battery temperature, time, battery_rating, charging_cycle, acceleration, battery_current, battery_voltage, humidity.
- **Controller:** Esp32 WROOM - Dual Antenna, + Arduino Nano.

### Software
- **Programming Language:** Embedded C
- **Autonomy:** Wireless Teleoperation, Using Shock-Burst Protocol, and NRF24L01 RF Module.
- **Website and database:** PHP, MySQL, Hostgator(hosting service + database)
- **Website for viewing Live Data(removed support by now):** http://ioioioio.in/ind.php

## Acknowledgments

This project was made possible through the guidance and support of [Prof. Shikha Singh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/professor-profile/). I am deeply grateful for her expertise and mentorship throughout the project.

## Whatâ€™s Next?

WUnfortunately, I will not be trying to update this Project, as my interests have shifted to legged robots as of now. However, it was still a great learning experience, and well worth the time and effort!

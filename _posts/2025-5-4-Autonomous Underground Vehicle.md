# Autonomous Load Haul Dumper: Design, Basic Implementation, in Simulation

A foundational framework, currently under development, for deployment on underground vehicles.

**Current Progress:**

Initial simulation environment established, featuring a functional client interface with verified autonomous traversal to target destinations.

## ROS2 Based Controller

ROS2 based controller is implemented here for controlling the **Wheel Velocities**, and **Pivot Joint** of the LHD.

### Overview

This video shows the following:

- **LEFT**: physics simulation
- **RIGHT**: visualization of position, and predicted trajectory using NMPC (green).
- A brief view of the client interface is shown at the begining where the target location is selected.

## Technical Details

### Hardware
- **Currently non existent (In development)**

### Software
- **Programming Language:** Python, C++.
- **Autonomy:** Fully autonomous drive to Target site (static environment).

#### Source Code

The codebase for the project will not be made public due to institute regulations, however, the software stack used is listed below.

- ROS2:(python) Slam-toolbox, Nav2.
- Non-linear Model Predictive control(NMPC): casadi, numpy.
- Path planning: (python) basic A* implementation.
